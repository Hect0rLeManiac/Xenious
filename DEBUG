So how to build and debug,

Download this repoistory as a zip or if you have the github app then clone it.
Open "Xenious.sln" in Microsoft Visual Studip C# 2015 (Free Edition) or other.

Then Set to debug, it will show the current break points.

The code has now been split, it has a launcher that launches currently a meta editor
and the xex local debugger, I still dont have a RGH console to check whats in the memory,
but when I get my hands on one I will map the memory out for the kernel and the other stuff,
like 1bl, hypervisor and xboxkernal.

So currently im trying to get it to load the main app executable into the xenon memory file,
with imports too, you will notice that the loader dialog when you load up the xex editor will attempt
to load the local (some games have them when you extract them from iso and stfs) and available kernal
imports, if you include them which are (xapi.xex, xam.xex, xboxkrnl.exe, xbdm.xex) but they wont load yet.

Next is to load the entry point, but some hwere there is a bug in the code that means they arnt loading,
So todo, but you get the jist, it loads into the entry point, attempts to find the ending point, 
then next round we would just keep looping to get the other functions and sub functions.

When I get the time and the equipment to do this I will update the executable :)
